The step function is where you can implement the player's strategy based on the abilities and rules of the game. The Actor class represents an individual actor in the simulation, such as a military unit or a state or a country. Each player has different characteristics, including a unique ID, the ability to randomly choose from among players, the type of player's strategy, and finally the color assigned to it for display on the war game screen. It is important to mention here that although the selection of the actor is written randomly using the random method, it is possible to limit the possible choices to the input conditions by the programmer, and therefore the degree of randomness can be controlled. Was. The capability property shows the actor's military ability and a random value between 1 and 10 is assigned to it during initialization. The strategy feature shows the actor's current strategy, which is set to \"attack\" for all actors, but it is possible to define the strategy in multiple ways based on the needs of the performers and create the possibility of choosing each actor with a different strategy. The step method of the Actor class implements the actor's strategy. If the strategy is \"Attack\", the chosen player selects a random neighboring player as a target and deals damage based on its ability.\n. We have tried to explain all the lines of code in the program. As can be seen in the class below, first the actors are randomly selected and then to implement the strategy of the actors, after defining the step, we proceed to define the attack strategy. The capability of each actor is chosen with a random number, but the strategy is defined by default in attack mode, which assumes that this attack is against a random target of the defending actor class, which is located in the neighborhood of the attacker. If in this attack, the ability of the target drops to zero or less, the target is removed from the game.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Actor(Agent):\n    def __init__(self, unique_id, model):\n        super().__init__(unique_id, model)\n        self.capability = self.random.randint(1, 10) # Assign random capabilities to each actor\n        self.strategy = \"attack\" # Set strategy to \"attack\" for all actors\n        self.color = None\n\n    def step(self):\n        # Implement actor's strategy\n        if self.strategy == \"attack\":\n            # Find neighboring cells with other actors\n            neighbors = self.model.grid.get_neighbors(self.pos, moore=True, include_center=False)\n            targets = [agent for agent in neighbors if isinstance(agent, Actor) and agent.unique_id != self.unique_id]\n            if targets:\n                # Attack a random target\n                target = self.random.choice(targets)\n                damage = self.random.randint(1, self.capability)\n                target.capability -= damage\n                # Check if the target is defeated\n                if target.capability <= 0:\n                    self.model.grid.remove_agent(target)\n                    self.model.schedule.remove(target)\n\nclass Warfare(Model):\n    def __init__(self, num_actors, width, height):\n        self.num_actors = num_actors\n        self.grid = MultiGrid(width, height, torus=True)\n        self.schedule = RandomActivation(self)\n        self.casualties = []\n        \n        # Create actors\n        for i in range(self.num_actors):\n            actor = Actor(i, self)\n            actor.color = RED if i % 2 == 0 else BLUE # Assign colors to actors based on their unique_id\n            self.schedule.add(actor)\n            x = self.random.randrange(self.grid.width)\n            y = self.random.randrange(self.grid.height)\n            self.grid.place_agent(actor, (x, y))\n        \n        self.running = True\n        self.winner = None\n\n    def step(self):\n        self.schedule.step()\n        # Check for victory or defeat conditions\n        num_alive = sum([1 for agent in self.schedule.agents if isinstance(agent, Actor)])\n        if num_alive == 0:\n            self.running = False\n            self.winner = \"Draw\"\n        elif num_alive == 1:\n            self.running = False\n            self.winner = \"Actor \" + str([agent for agent in self.schedule.agents if isinstance(agent, Actor)][0].unique_id)\n        self.casualties.append(self.num_actors - len(self.schedule.agents))\n    \n    def get_casualties(self):\n        return self.num_actors - len(self.schedule.agents)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Initialize Pygame\n    pygame.init()\n    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((500, 500))\n    pygame.display.set_caption(\"Warfare Simulation\")\n\n    # Create model\n    model = Warfare(num_actors= 32, width= 100, height= 100)\n\n    # Main simulation loop\n    with tqdm(total=100) as pbar:\n        while model.running:\n            # Handle events\n            for event in pygame.event.get():\n                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                    model.running = False\n\n            # Clear the screen\n            screen.fill((255, 255, 255))\n\n            # Draw actors\n            for actor in model.schedule.agents:\n                x, y = actor.pos\n                pygame.draw.rect(screen, actor.color, (x*10, y*10, 10, 10))\n\n            # Update the model\n            model.step()\n\n            # Update the screen\n            pygame.display.flip()\n\n            # Update the progress bar\n            pbar.update(1)\n\n            # Optional delay to slow down the simulation\n            # time.sleep(0.1)\n\n    # Print the outcome of the simulation\n    if model.winner:\n        print(\"The winner is:\", model.winner)\n    else:\n        print(\"The simulation ended in a draw\")\n\n    print(\"Casualties:\", model.get_casualties())\n\n    # Plot the casualties over time\n    plt.plot(model.casualties)\n    plt.title(\"Casualties over time\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Iteration\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Casualties\")\n    plt.show()\n\n    # Create a report on the simulation\n    report = f\"\"\"Simulation Outcome:\n    Winner: {model.winner or 'Draw'}\n    Casualties: {model.get_casualties()}\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(report)\n\n    # Quit Pygame\n    pygame.quit()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-01T00:13:45.191639Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-01T00:13:45.192036Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-01T00:13:45.531331Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-01T00:13:45.192007Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-01T00:13:45.529903Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the above class, the actors try to find their neighbors among the actors and randomly attack the targets.

Obviously, according to the practical problem, each of these items can be added to the above class. Further, the Warfare class is also implemented as follows. In this class, first, the length and width of the battle scene is determined and based on the number of selected actors, blue and red colors are assigned to the defender and attacker, respectively, and the actors are randomly distributed on the screen with small squares. Then, in each step of the simulation, the conditions of victory or defeat are established and the number of killed, victorious and playing players is determined. The Warfare class represents the simulation model. This model includes features such as num_actors, grid, schedule and casualties. The num_actors property determines the number of actors in the simulation. The grid feature shows the multi-grid space where the actors are placed and interact with each other. The schedule attribute manages the activation order of the actors. The casualty property is a list that keeps track of the number of actors (casualties) in each iteration of the simulation.
